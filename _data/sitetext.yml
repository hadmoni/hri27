This way, each paper gets showcased individually to the community, but presenters can get into more depth with those who are interested during the poster session. We hope this format maintains the cohesion of the HRI community while providing researchers with multiple occasions to share their work."

During the workshop day, we will organize **site visits to local company offices**, where attendees can learn more about industry research. The program will also include three **panel discussions with top researchers from industry and academia**. Each panel will cover a different timely topic such as “HRI in the LLM Era” or “Where’s the Real World Impact?”. We hope that having a mix of speakers will provide different perspectives, highlight the connections between industry and academia, and inspire further cross-domain collaboration."

    title: "Innovative HRI"
    body: "Silicon Valley, a world-renowned center of technological innovation and creativity, is the perfect setting for the HRI 2027 conference. The area boasts an extraordinary ecosystem of startups, established tech giants, and cutting-edge university research labs. We aim to leverage this proximity to industry to provide conference attendees with unique networking opportunities that can inspire collaboration and new ideas in human-robot interaction.<br><br>

      San Jose is the largest city in Silicon Valley, with a population of nearly 1 million people in 2022. The area is home to 6,600 companies including top tech companies like Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Adobe, Tesla, Fetch Robotics, NVIDIA, Meta, and Google. There are also many research universities in the area, including Stanford University, University of California - Berkeley, University of California - Santa Cruz, and San Jose State University.<br><br>

      Outside of the conference, Silicon Valley offers a variety of cultural and natural attractions. Attendees can explore the history of technology at the Computer History Museum, admire a diverse collection of contemporary pieces at the San Jose Museum of Art, or take a short trip to San Francisco to experience its historical architecture and vibrant art and food scenes. San Jose is one of the most diverse cities in the United States, with cultural neighborhoods like Japantown, Little Portugal, Little Italy, and Little Saigon. Nature lovers can visit the beautiful Pacific coastline or hike the scenic trails in the Santa Cruz Mountains, and the nearby Muir Woods National Monument offers a chance to wander among towering redwoods.<br><br>

      Inspired by the Silicon Valley spirit of invention, this year’s theme will be “Innovative HRI”. As we enter an era of renewed interest in AI and Robotics, there's never been a better moment to promote awareness of our field and build connections with the dozens of startups and research labs that have been driving advancements in robotics. By hosting HRI 2027 in Silicon Valley, we're choosing more than just a conference venue; we're helping to position our field to better influence the future of robotics."
