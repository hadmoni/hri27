    list:
      - title: "Main paper presentations"
        desc: "We aim to continue HRI’s tradition of a single-track program. To maintain a target 25% acceptance rate while submission numbers continue to increase, we will employ a hybrid presentation model. All main conference papers will be presented in a single track, with 5-minute spotlight talks followed by a 1-hour poster session featuring 18–24 papers from that oral session. While this reduces the length of each individual paper’s talk, the supplementary poster session enables speakers to engage in more depth with those who are interested. This follows a similar structure to RSS 2024 and other conferences."
        icon: fas fa-microphone
      - title: "Extended conference duration"
        desc: "In addition to the hybrid presentation model, we propose handling an increase in papers by extending the main conference to a fourth day. The final day will end earlier than other days to allow people to travel home that afternoon. Thus, the conference would run over five days (one workshop day and four conference days). This is similar to the duration of HRI 2024, which had two workshop days and three conference days. More details about the proposed schedule changes can be found in the Schedule section below."
        icon: far fa-clock
      - title: "Daily panels"
        desc: "As attendance increases and HRI attracts attention from other fields, we aim to help maintain some common ground across the community by introducing daily panel discussions. These panels will bring together top researchers from both academia and industry, in keeping with our theme of \"Innovative HRI\". Each panel will cover a different timely topic such as “HRI in the LLM Era” or “Where’s the Real World Impact?” We hope that having a mix of speakers will provide different perspectives, highlight the connections between industry and academia, and inspire further cross-domain collaboration. The panels will complement the traditional keynotes, paper talks, and poster sessions."

  about:
    title: "\"Innovative HRI\""
    body: "Silicon Valley, a world-renowned center of technological innovation and creativity, is the perfect setting for the HRI 2027 conference. The area boasts an extraordinary ecosystem of startups, established tech giants, and cutting-edge university research labs. We aim to leverage this proximity to industry to provide conference attendees with unique networking opportunities that can inspire collaboration and new ideas in human-robot interaction.<br><br>

      San Jose is the largest city in Silicon Valley, with a population of nearly 1 million people in 2022. The area is home to 6,600 companies including top tech companies like Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Adobe, Tesla, Fetch Robotics, NVIDIA, Meta, and Google. There are also many research universities in the area, including Stanford University, University of California - Berkeley, University of California - Santa Cruz, and San Jose State University.<br><br>

      Outside of the conference, Silicon Valley offers a variety of cultural and natural attractions. Attendees can explore the history of technology at the Computer History Museum, admire a diverse collection of contemporary pieces at the San Jose Museum of Art, or take a short trip to San Francisco to experience its historical architecture and vibrant art and food scenes. San Jose is one of the most diverse cities in the United States, with cultural neighborhoods like Japantown, Little Portugal, Little Italy, and Little Saigon. Nature lovers can visit the beautiful Pacific coastline or hike the scenic trails in the Santa Cruz Mountains, and the nearby Muir Woods National Monument offers a chance to wander among towering redwoods.<br><br>

      Inspired by the Silicon Valley spirit of invention, this year’s theme will be “Innovative HRI”. As we enter an era of renewed interest in AI and Robotics, there's never been a better moment to promote awareness of our field and build connections with the dozens of startups and research labs that have been driving advancements in robotics. By hosting HRI 2027 in Silicon Valley, we're choosing more than just a conference venue; we're helping to position our field to better influence the future of robotics."

  schedule:
    title: "Potential Schedule"
    text: ""
    image: assets/img/schedule.png
    body: "<p>This single-track schedule supports 132 full papers (including Alt.HRI), as well as a daily keynote presentation, three panels, Late Breaking Reports, a Student Design Competition, and Short Contributions. </p>

     <p>Each full paper will be presented in a 5-minute talk (including switching time), and each group of talks will be followed immediately by a poster session. In this way, all papers have a chance to be individually spotlighted, but authors can also answer questions and engage with the audience in smaller discussions. Most talk blocks are 1.5 hours long (18 paper presented), followed by a 1 hour poster session. On the final day, we extend this to a 2 hour long talk block and a 1.5 hour poster session.</p>

     <p>Each day, there will also be a poster session for papers from auxiliary tracks (LBRs, Short Contributions, etc.). Throughout the conference, Video contributions will be displayed on televisions in the main gathering spaces. </p>"
