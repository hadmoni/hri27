Kate Tsui is the Program Manager of Toyota Research Instituteâ€™s University Research Partnership program, and formerly the Department Head of the Human-Robot Interaction department (2024) and co-lead the Robotics User Experience and Interaction Design (RUX-ID) team (2023). Her HRI research focuses on people's trust towards home robot helpers and using robotic technology to physically assist Older Adults for mobility, stability, and transfer tasks (e.g., sit to stand) and help with social isolation and loneliness. During her tenure at TRI, Dr. Tsui has been awarded 3 patents. Dr. Tsui holds a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Massachusetts Lowell (2014) and was a postdoctoral associate at Yale University (2014-2016). Her human-robot interaction and human-computer interaction research interests stem from the cross section of computer science, robotics, and assistive technology. Dr. Tsui has developed robotic systems and user interfaces and interactions for people with cognitive and motor impairments as the target end-user, including a vision-based wheelchair-mounted robotic arm, social telepresence robots, and a socially assistive robot. Over the last 18 years, she has worked with end users from several special populations (children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, teenagers and young adults with Cerebral Palsy, adults and seniors with Brain Injury, and deaf infants), clinicians (Occupational Therapists, Physical Therapists, and Gerontechnologist), and directors of residential care facilities (People Living with Dementia, Traumatic Brain Injury). Dr. Tsui sits on the Advisory Boards for the AI-CARING Institute, Quori 2.0 project, and the Kennedy College of Sciences.
