Katie Winkle is an Assistant Professor in Social Robotics at Uppsala University, Sweden, where she co-leads the Uppsala Social Robotics Laboratory and is building a new design studio focused on Human-Machine Futures. Her research is concerned with delivering ‘real-world’ effective, ethical human-robot interactions; with recent research projects being focused on expert-led robot development of social robots in health and education settings alongside developing notions of Feminist human-robot interaction. Previous to her appointment at Uppsala, Katie was awarded a Digital Futures Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at KTH Royal Institute of Technology following her PhD in Robotics and Autonomous Systems at the Bristol Robotics Laboratory (University of Bristol, University of the West of England) UK. She also holds a MEng degree in Mechanical Engineering (First Class Honours) from the University of Bristol, UK. Her award winning work (2x HRI Best Paper Awards and 1x additional nomination) has been featured in international media (including e.g. televised appearances on the BBC and newspaper interviews for Sweden’s largest daily newspaper, Dagens Nyheter). Her service to the HRI community was recognised by a Community Service Award for outstanding contribution and support in the organisation of HRI 2023 as a local arrangements chair.
