Paul Robinette is an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Massachusetts Lowell (UML). He has performed extensive experiments on human-robot trust in time-critical situations in virtual simulations, the lab, and the field. In recent years, he focused on field robotics: in-situ human-robot teaming experiments in the marine domain and field experiments for river navigation of autonomous surface vehicles. These projects have yielded datasets that have been released for the human-robot interaction community and the marine robotics community. In addition to the prior HRI roles, he has been active on organizing/program committees for ICRA (2025, 2022, 2021), ICSR (2024), Symposium on Trustworthy Autonomous Systems (2024), RO-MAN (2024, 2023), and Ubiquitous Robotics (2021).

**Previous HRI roles: Program Committee AC (2025, 2024, 2022), Telepresence Co-Chair (2019)**
