I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at Imperial College London in the Department of Computing. I am also part of the exciting new Imperial-X initiative.


My research focuses on developing robots that shape human interactions in complex and dynamic environments throughout day-to-day tasks. I do this by building robots that create user models and give personalized feedback for long-term skill acquisition. Additionally, I study different ways that robots can positively influence people.
